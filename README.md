The Bluetooth Audio Transmitter 
Summary:

Is an input and output audio device and allows users to play music with a 3.5 mm jack. The user is able to connect their device to the transmitter and select a song of their choice and it will output in a connected speaker via bluetooth connection. The user is able to adjust the volume to their speaker and use this speaker for music and conference calls. The Bluetooth Audio Transmitter is battery powered, and can be replaced when battery dies. This project is significant in today’s world because it is able to do real time signal processing which leads to less delays in sound and creating an efficient sound. Many devices have delay in sound, which can cause inaccuracy and frustrations with devices. 

The Bluetooth Audio Transmitter key features are a potentiometer to adjust volume in sound level that you want to play and incorporates a speaker within the device. Many Bluetooth Audio Transmitter do not have a connected speaker which sets our device apart from the rest of devices that are similar. The overall goal for this device is for a successful, clear, audio output so that the user is able to use this device to its fullest potential. The main goal as well is to create a device able to be compatible with most devices in the world regardless of what type of audio device the user is using for audio connection. 

The design itself is able to carry out all its functions with just needing an audio device from the user. The wooden frame’s purpose is so it can encompass the whole device and also protect it from damage. The wooden frame will allow the device to be portable and still weigh less than a pound. Our goal was to allow this device to be durable and portable. The user will only have to input their device to the 3.5 mm jack and play their audio. This allows for the device to be used by any user regardless of prior knowledge with this technology. 

To allow for a simple design we worked in creating a simplistic, but efficient design that does not diminish the quality of sound. Some of the challenges we faced mainly consisted of register programming and electrical circuit such as the DAC, Power Amplifier, and Low-Pass Filter.We tackled these problems in separate parts. When designing our hardware we made sure the signal (20 - 40 KHz) behaved as expected through the specific hardware components.  For example, the 3.5mm jack outputted a 20 - 40 KHz sine wave signal on the oscilloscope which was then measured after the DAC to get a 20 - 40 KHz sine wave signal. The signal then went into a Low-Pass Filter which allowed us to pass lower signals than the cutoff frequency, the Amplifier which amplified the signal and then outputted to the speaker. Our overall achievement was being to capture the an analog signal, deconstruct it, and reconstruct it after to recreate the signal that was original inputted.Through all these challenges we were able to keep our idea of a simplistic design, but efficient in quality.
